Provides an implementation for the ENVISAT product reader plug-in and defines several
stand-alone classes for the direct access of ENVISAT data products.

<H3>ENVISAT Product Reader Plug-in</H3>

<p>The ENVISAT product reader is implemented by two classes
<OL>
    <LI>{@link org.esa.snap.dataio.envisat.EnvisatProductReaderPlugIn} - The plug-in which serves as a factory for
        the actual reader
    <LI>{@link org.esa.snap.dataio.envisat.EnvisatProductReader} - The "worker" class doing the reading, one
        instance per product file
</OL>

<p>The "normal" way to obtain an instance of an ENVISAT product reader through the
    product I/O framework of the MERIS/(A)ATSR Toolbox is very simple:

<pre>
    // Get a reader instance for the ENVISAT format
    ProductReader reader = ProductIO.getReader("ENVISAT");
</pre>

<p>Once the reader is obtained the product can be read into memory:

<pre>
    // Read the product, no subset given
    Product product = reader.readProduct("E:/data/MERIS/L1B/MER_FR__1P.prd", null);
</pre>

<p><I>Important</I>: The product I/O framework does not automatically load the raster data
    of geophysical bands contained in the product. This must be done explicitely. In the
    following code snippet an entire band is loaded:

<pre>
    // get the band named radiance_2
    RsBand band = product.getBand("radiance_2");
    // load the entire band
    Raster raster = band.loadData();
    // ... do something with the raster data in 'raster'
</pre>

<p>If just a portion of a band is desired, e.g. in order to read a band line-by-line,
    the product reader should be used instead:

<pre>
    // Create a raster for a single scan line.
    Raster lineRaster = band.createCompatibleRaster(new Rectangle(0, 0, band.getWidth(), 1));
    float[] lineData = ((DataBufferFloat) lineRaster.getDataBuffer()).getData();
    // The offset where reading begins (in the data product's pixel co-ordinates)
    Point offset = new Point(0, 0);
    // Read line-by-line
    for (int y = 0; y &lt; band.getHeight(); y++) {
    offset.y = y;
    // The next read call modifies the contents in 'lineData'
    reader.readBandData(band, lineRaster, offset);
    // ... do something with the data in 'lineData'
    }
</pre>

<p>The {@link org.esa.snap.dataio.envisat.EnvisatProductReader} class implements the {@link
    org.esa.snap.core.dataio.ProductReader}
    interface by delegating low level read operations to an instance of the {@link
    org.esa.snap.dataio.envisat.ProductFile} class.
    Developers can also use <code>ProductFile</code> class directly in order to access ENVISAT
    product files. There is no need to use use the product I/O framework.

<H3>Direct Product File Access (doing it without the product I/O framework)</H3>

<p>The classes in this package provide direct reading of ENVISAT data in two different ways:
<OL>
    <LI>Raw data access - data is read in its raw and native form, without applying any modifications to it.
    <LI>Geophysical data access - data is first read in its raw form, but then decoded and scaled
        in order to retrieve the true geophysical parameters in their actual physical units. Tie point
        datasets are used to create additional geophysical parameters. A band created from tie points
        has the same resolution as the other bands - pixels are retrieved by linear interpolation
        between four tie points.
</OL>

<H4>Raw Data Access</H4>

<p>The starting point in both cases is the <code>ProductFile</code> class. It has a static method which
    allows to open a data product file. From the opened product file a record reader for raw data access
    can be obtained for each of the datasets contained in the product. The record reader is - as the name says -
    used to read single records. Records are again composed of fields carrying the data. Each field can have
    multiple data elements stored in an native array type. For example, in ENVISAT products all samples of a
    scan line are stored in a single field as part of a measurement dataset record ('MDSR' in ENVISAT
    terminology). The following code snipped shows how to read a measurement dataset in it's raw form
    record-by-record:

<pre>
    ProductFile file = ProductFile.open("E:/data/MERIS/L1B/MER_FR__1P.prd");
    RecordReader reader = file.getRecordReader("Norm._rho_surf_-_MDS(2)");
    // Pre-create a record with a well defined structure
    Record record = reader.createCompatibleRecord();
    // Process all records
    int n = reader.getNumRecords();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
    // Read the record from the file
    reader.readRecord(i, record);
    // we know from the ENVISAT spec., samples are stored in the 3rd field
    Field field = record.getFieldAt(2);
    // we know from the ENVISAT spec., samples are stored as 2241 (unsigned) 16-bit values
    short[] samples = (short[]) field.getData();
    // ... do something with the data
    }
</pre>

In this example we pre-created the record before we read data into it. By passing this record
to the <code>reader.readRecord()</code> method it gets recycled, and the field data is
overwritten each time the method is called. If record data should remain in the fields,
new records should be created for each read call: Then, replace the
<pre>
    reader.readRecord(i, record);
</pre>
by the non-recycling call
<pre>
    record = reader.readRecord(i, null);
</pre>

Now, each time the method is called a new record is created, read-in and returned.

<H4>Geophysical Data Access</H4>

Geophysical data is read into Java's in-build {@link java.awt.image.WritableRaster WritableRaster}s. As for raw data,
first the file is opened using the static <code>ProductFile.open</code> method. But this time a <tag>BandReader</tag>
is used instead of a <tag>RercordReader</tag>. Then, a raster compatible for the desired band is created and data
finally read into it. The following snippet shows this programming model:

<pre>
    ProductFile file = ProductFile.open("E:/data/MERIS/L1B/MER_FR__1P.prd");
    BandReader reader = file.getBandReader("radiance_2");
    // Create a raster covering the entrire product scene
    Raster raster = reader.createCompatibleRaster();
    readBandRaster(raster, null, 1, 1);
    float[] data = ((DataBufferFloat) raster.getDataBuffer()).getData();
    // ... do something with the data in 'data'
    file.close();
</pre>


Reading the complete band is not often the best choice, particulary if multiple
huge band rasters have to be processed. The one should consider reading the band
line by line as shown in the following example:

<pre>
    ProductFile file = ProductFile.open("E:/data/MERIS/L1B/MER_FR__1P.prd");
    int sceneWidth = file.getNumColumns();
    int sceneHeight = file.getNumLines();
    BandReader reader = file.getBandReader("radiance_2");
    // Define the area from which to read (in the product's pixel co-ordinates)
    Rectangle sourceArea = new Rectangle(0, 0, sceneWidth, 1);
    // Create a raster covering one single scan line
    WritableRaster lineRaster = reader.createCompatibleRaster(sourceArea, 1, 1);
    float[] lineData = ((DataBufferFloat) lineRaster.getDataBuffer()).getData();
    for (int y = 0; y &lt; sceneHeight; y++) {
    sourceArea.y = y;
    // The next read call modifies the contents in 'lineData'
    reader.readBandRaster(lineRaster, sourceArea, 1, 1);
    // ... do something with the data in 'lineData'
    }
    file.close();
</pre>
